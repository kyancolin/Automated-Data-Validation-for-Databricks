🛠️ Automated Data Quality Checks for Incoming Files 📊

Welcome to the Automated Data Quality Checks project! This Python-based tool ensures that incoming datasets meet high-quality standards by validating various aspects such as missing values, duplicates, range limits, and format consistency. ✅
📌 Features

    🗓️ Date Validation (Datumvalidatie.py) – Ensures dates are in the correct format and within an acceptable range.
    🔄 Duplicate Check (Duplication check.py) – Identifies and flags duplicate records to prevent redundancy.
    🚫 Null Value Detection (Null check.py) – Checks for missing values in crucial fields and generates reports.
    📏 Range Validation (Rangevalidation.py) – Verifies if numeric values fall within predefined limits.
