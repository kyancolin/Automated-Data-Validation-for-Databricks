# 🛠️ Automated Data Quality Checks for Incoming Files 📊

Welcome to the Automated Data Quality Checks project! This Python-based tool ensures that incoming datasets meet high-quality standards by validating missing values, duplicates, range limits, and more.

## 📌 Features

- 🗓️ **Date Validation** (`Datumvalidatie.py`) – Ensures dates are in the correct format and within an acceptable range.
- 🔄 **Duplicate Check** (`Duplication_check.py`) – Identifies and flags duplicate records to prevent redundancy.
- 🚫 **Null Value Detection** (`Null_check.py`) – Checks for missing values in crucial fields and generates reports.
- 📏 **Range Validation** (`Rangevalidation.py`) – Verifies if numeric values fall within predefined limits.

## 🏗️ Setup & Requirements

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed. 🐍
- No external libraries required – just clone and run! 🚀

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kyancolin/Automated-Data-Validation-for-Databricks.git
    ```

2. Run the desired script:

    ```bash
    python Duplication_check.py
    ```

3. Check the generated reports 📄

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🏗️ Integration with Databricks for enterprise-level automation.
- 📊 Visualization tools to present validation reports interactively.
- ⏳ Performance optimizations for large datasets.
